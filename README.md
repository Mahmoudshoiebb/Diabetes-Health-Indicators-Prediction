# Diabetes-Health-Indicators-Prediction
This repository contains an end-to-end classification project to predict the likelihood of diabetes using health indicators. The goal is to preprocess the dataset, explore and select features, train multiple classification models, tune hyperparameters, and evaluate model performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC).
